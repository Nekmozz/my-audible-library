Unlike their siblings, they remain cautious and observant, aware of the dangers that lurk in the dungeon they call home. They watch as larger and more powerful beasts prey on other reckless, foolish spiders, developing a sense of self-preservation and a cunning intelligence they alone seem to possess.</p> <p>Now identifying as Click, the spider has matured, discovering they are capable of an array of amazing abilities . . . of both body <i>and</i> mind. They can spin and launch webs, not only to catch prey but to sense the vibrations of those who stray onto their silken strands. Influencing the colony with their hunting strategies, Click can command other spiders to do their bidding, forging an army capable of attacking—and killing—even the most dangerous of the dungeon's predators.</p> <p>But the monsters roaming the dungeon are not Click's most dangerous enemies. An Alpha Hunter Spider rivals Click for dominance over their brethren, spreading chaos throughout the colony. And a group of beings Click has never encountered before raid the dungeon, disturbing the natural order. They wield objects and conjure incredible energy in their quest to acquire strange treasures, slaughtering all in their path.</p> <p>These invaders are called \"humans,\" and Click must lead the spiders in a merciless war against them in order to defend their home and ensure the very survival of their colony . . .</p> <p><b>The hit LitRPG adventure—with more than 500,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
