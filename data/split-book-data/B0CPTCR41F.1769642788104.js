Emptiness fills the eyes of people everywhere as their faces become as hard as the loveless hearts hidden beneath them. Those who are not involved in the war effort can only do their best to survive on the fringes for the time being.</p> <p>One of these people is the exiled, youngest princess of the nation, the ill Acacia Odofredus Krone, who lives forgotten in destitute squalor as an abject failure, not even capable enough to become a low-ranking adventurer. An equally lost soul, reborn from another world, suddenly finds himself reincarnated at her side as the powerful manifestation of a creature of old prophecy: der Schwarze Ritter—the Black Knight.</p> <p>Together, faced with the pressures of the horrific conflict, dire poverty, Acacia's fatal sickness, and the looming threat of her noble bloodline that hasn't been forgotten by the world hanging heavy over them, the two of them are forced onto a journey to find a way to live together, fighting their way out from the lowest shadows of forgottenhood in order to reach the pinnacle of either of their dreams—a life that feels like anything more than total emptiness.</p> <p>Can this desperate quest be anything other than doomed to failure?
