In a land where magic equals power, the choice of who can be trusted to use mana productively is now his to make, a responsibility he doesn't take lightly.</p> <p>Secretly, Justin (now known as Elian) is still learning the finer points of the manipulation of mana. As he experiments with the creation of coveted Earth items, even those that have little meaning in this place—iron, for example—he's called upon to make something his people truly need: weapons. And when the time comes, he'll pour himself into the creation of a weapon that could save lives, including his own, in a battle that will shake the foundations of his new world.</p> <p>Polishing the skills he's learned and determining what might be beneficial to introduce to some trusted others, Justin grows into a man with his own credo and rapid-fire use of mana. A teacher and a valued asset in the expansion of the kingdom, he'll face unthinkable obstacles and heart-breaking betrayals before the fierce, unexpected clash that will call on every one of his skills before the last man has fallen.</p> <p><b>The second volume of the hit progression-fantasy series—with almost 300,000 views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
