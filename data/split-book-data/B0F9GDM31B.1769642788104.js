She's in desperate need of some friends who can help her navigate what's looking to be a heap of trouble.</p> <p>Most pressingly, there's the disappearance of a harpy delegation from the Harpy Mountains. After the entire small fleet, including several diplomats, fails to show up to one of the most important summits in recent history, it becomes overwhelmingly clear that something nefarious is afoot.</p> <p>With Broccoli's long-time nemesis Rainnewt stewing behind bars, who could be responsible for this kerfuffle?

One thing's for sure: the pressure's building, and Broccoli's crewmate Amaryllis might just pluck out her own headfeathers in exasperation. Broccoli knows that hope and a positive outlook can solve <i>most</i> issues, but will her friendliness be enough to save lives and prevent any unnecessary violence?</p> <p><b>The sixth volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—with more than nine million views on Royal Road—now available in paperback, ebook, and audiobook!</b></p>";
