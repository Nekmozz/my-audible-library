Since then, he's mastered mana, built a reputation for himself by crafting fascinating machines based on human technology, and even managed to forge some true and trusted relationships. But his path hasn't always been an easy one, and a recent war has left him in his most perilous position yet.</p> <p>Cino and Atal, two of the land ruling ancients, are dead—and one of them at Justin's hand. According to tradition, that leaves Justin with the unenviable task of spreading the word to the neighboring kingdoms, alerting the other ancients that two of their own have passed, leaving their territories unclaimed.</p> <p>To accomplish this quest, Justin will need to cross vast and varied lands, from uncanny forests and frozen plateaus to fiery coastlines and deep bogs. But the true threat to his mission are the millenia-old beings that he'll need to go toe-to-toe with. Powered by unthinkable abilities, they are formidable foes, and Justin must stay focused to avoid getting drawn into their games. Because when it comes to ancient grudges, no one can escape completely unscathed.</p> <p><b>The third volume of the hit progression-fantasy series—with almost 300,000 views on Royal Road—now available in paperback, ebook, and audiobook!</b></p>";
