We fought day and night to keep the baddies at bay and the Earth safe. But, one day, our best wasn't good enough.</p> <p>So, we huddled up for a superhero brainstorm and decided to pool our powers for this mega, super-duper save-the-day plan. We kinda goofed. Big time. Instead of saving the day, we accidentally wiped out a quarter of the Milky Way.</p> <p>Now, here I am, Crystal Genocide, in a bit of a pickle. I've landed on this bizarre planet, surrounded by odd monsters and folks who have magic that feels way too familiar. It's like they're copying our style, but not quite getting it right. My mission? Unravel this magic mystery, track down my magical girl gang, and maybe, just maybe, put back together the pieces of our home that we kinda, sorta blew up. Hopefully, I won't accidentally destroy this world too! Wish me luck!</p>";
